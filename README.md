### Introduction

 RN-Paradox is a dedicated team of software developers and engineers who strive to build innovative and cutting-edge solutions. We understand the importance of efficiency and reliability in the software development lifecycle. This CI/CD pipeline is a critical part of our development process, enabling us to automate tasks, ensure code quality, and deliver code changes to production with confidence.

### CI/CD Pipeline Overview
Our CI/CD pipeline is built to automate the following processes:

- Continuous Integration (CI): Whenever code changes are pushed to the version control system (e.g., GitHub), the CI pipeline automatically triggers a series of tests and builds to validate the changes and ensure they integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase.

- Continuous Deployment (CD): Once the CI process passes all the tests, the CD pipeline automatically deploys the changes to the production environment. This ensures a smooth and rapid delivery of features and bug fixes to end-users.


### Features
The CI/CD pipeline includes the following key features:

- Automated code quality checks
- Automated testing (unit tests and  integration tests)
- Code coverage analysis
- Deployment automation
- Notification alerts for pipeline status
